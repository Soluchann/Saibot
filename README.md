# ðŸ¤– Saibot â€“ Resume-Aware Chatbot

Saibot is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based personal chatbot that answers questions specifically related to my resume. It uses a LLM and a vector store to ground its responses in my experience, skills, and background.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- resume is split into chunks and embedded using a sentence transformer  
- Embeddings are stored in a vector database (neo4j)  
- When you ask a question, the chatbot:
  - Converts the query to a vector  
  - Retrieves the most relevant chunks from my resume  
  - Feeds both the query and the retrieved context to the LLM  
  - The LLM responds based only on my actual resume data
